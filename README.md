This is an incomplete battle simulator for Pokemon Ruby. It is planned to support every usable move and Pokemon, totaling at most 65,536 for each (and that number includes glitch moves/Pokemon).

If you are interested in contributing to this project, I am in the Discord server for Ruby Hacked Glitchmons under the username (not display name) "electra102". The link to the Discord server for Ruby Hacked Glitchmons is https://discord.gg/QkByYv9hze

If you want to use this sim when it is fully released, you will need to provide it a valid ROM of Pokemon Ruby. The simulator will take care of checking to see if the ROM is valid or not. However, I cannot legally provide an online source for this ROM.
